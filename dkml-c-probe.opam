  "Cross-compiler friendly ABI and library discovery for OCaml's native C compilers"
description: """
dkml-c-probe simplifies the creation of cross-compiling compatible foreign C stub code. It includes two components:

C_abi: Introspects OCaml's native C compiler, including cross-compilers, to determine the ABI those C compilers will generate
C_conf: Supplies flags to C compilers and OCaml tools that specify the locations of C headers and C libraries"""
